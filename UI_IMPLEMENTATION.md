- ✅ Filtering by file pattern (regex support)
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

### 2. Implemented Markdown Rendering (MarkdownViewer Component)
**File:** `/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/specstar/src/components/markdown-viewer.tsx`

- ✅ Integrated document-viewer library for markdown rendering
- ✅ Full markdown syntax support with terminal-friendly formatting
- ✅ Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- ✅ Frontmatter extraction and display
- ✅ Scrollable content with keyboard navigation:
  - Arrow keys / j,k for line scrolling
  - Page Up/Down / u,d for page scrolling
  - g/G for top/bottom navigation
- ✅ Line number indicators and scroll position

### 3. Created ObserveView Component
**File:** `/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/specstar/src/views/ObserveView.tsx`

- ✅ Real-time Claude Code session monitoring
- ✅ Integration with session-monitor library
- ✅ Display of active sessions with statistics
- ✅ Recent events stream (file changes, commands, errors)
- ✅ Session history browsing
- ✅ Session statistics dashboard:
  - Duration tracking
  - File operation counts
  - Command execution statistics
- ✅ Multi-pane layout with keyboard navigation

### 4. Wired Up PlanView
**File:** `/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/specstar/src/views/plan-view.tsx`

- ✅ Dynamic loading of files from specs/ directory
- ✅ File selection handling with auto-switch to viewer
- ✅ Three file lists: Docs, Specs, Templates
- ✅ Integration with MarkdownViewer for content display
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for pane navigation (1-3, V)
- ✅ Selected file tracking and display

### 5. Updated App.tsx for View Switching
**File:** `/Users/dylan/Workspace/projects/specstar/src/app.tsx`

- ✅ Welcome screen with animated logo (using ink-gradient and ink-big-text)
- ✅ View switching between Plan and Observe modes
- ✅ Global keyboard shortcuts:
  - P: Switch to Plan View
  - O: Switch to Observe View
  - H/?: Show help/welcome screen
  - Q: Quit application
- ✅ Visual mode indicators with colored borders
- ✅ Auto-transition from welcome to Plan view

## Architecture

### Component Hierarchy
```
App
├── Welcome Screen (with BigText + Gradient)
├── Plan View
│   ├── FileList (Docs)
│   ├── FileList (Specs - dynamic)
│   ├── FileList (Templates)
│   └── MarkdownViewer
└── Observe View
    ├── Current Session Panel
    ├── Recent Events Panel
    ├── Session History Panel
    └── Session Statistics Panel
```

### Key Libraries Used
- **React Ink 6.3.0**: Terminal UI framework
- **document-viewer**: Custom markdown rendering for terminal
- **session-monitor**: Claude Code session tracking
- **marked**: Markdown parsing
- **cli-highlight**: Syntax highlighting
- **chalk**: Terminal colors
- **ink-gradient**: Rainbow text effects
- **ink-big-text**: ASCII art text

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
# Interactive mode (requires TTY)
bun run src/cli.tsx

# Or use the test script
./test-ui.sh
```

### Keyboard Navigation

#### Global Controls
- **P**: Switch to Plan View
- **O**: Switch to Observe View
- **H/?**: Show help screen
- **Q**: Quit (from welcome screen or views)

#### Plan View Controls
- **1-3**: Focus on Docs/Specs/Templates list
- **4/V**: Focus on document viewer
- **↑↓**: Navigate files in list
- **Enter**: Select and open file
- **R**: Refresh file list

#### Observe View Controls
- **1-3**: Switch between Current/History/Stats panes
- **↑↓**: Navigate history items
- **R**: Refresh session data

#### Document Viewer Controls
- **↑↓/j/k**: Scroll line by line
- **PgUp/PgDn/u/d**: Page scrolling
- **g/G**: Jump to top/bottom

## Testing

### Component Test
```bash
# Run component rendering tests
bun run test-components.tsx
```

### Manual Testing
The application requires an interactive terminal (TTY) for full functionality. Use the provided `test-ui.sh` script or run directly in a terminal emulator.

## Error Handling

All components include proper error handling:
- File loading errors display gracefully
- Missing directories are handled
- Session monitoring failures show error messages
- Network/filesystem errors are caught and displayed

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of file contents
- Debounced file watching in session monitor
- Efficient markdown rendering with caching
- Virtual scrolling for long documents
- Focused rendering (only active panes render content)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Search functionality within documents
- Session recording and playback
- Export session reports
- Customizable themes
- Plugin system for extensions
- Configuration file support
- Multi-project session tracking
- Integration with Claude Code hooks

## Known Limitations

1. Requires interactive terminal (TTY) for input handling
2. Session monitoring requires `.claude` directory to exist
3. Some markdown features may not render perfectly in terminal
4. Large files may need pagination optimization

## Troubleshooting

### "Raw mode not supported" Error
This occurs when running without a proper TTY. Ensure you're running in an interactive terminal, not through pipes or non-interactive shells.

### Files Not Loading
- Check directory permissions
- Verify paths in PlanView configuration
- Ensure specs/ directory exists

### Session Not Detected
- Verify `.claude` directory exists
- Check SessionMonitor configuration paths
- Ensure Claude Code is running and creating session files
