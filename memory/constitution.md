## Core Principles

### I. Library-First

Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries

### II. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### III. Simplicity

Start simple, YAGNI principles
