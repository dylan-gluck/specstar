# [PROJECT NAME] Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

## Constitutional Principles
- **Setup**: Test infrastructure AND pre-commit hooks together first
- **Testing**: 80% code, 20% tests PER TASK (implementation first, then tests before completion)
- **Files**: Max 250 lines per file
- **Code**: Simple, clean, self-explanatory (no comments)
- **Architecture**: Modular with single responsibilities
- **Communication**: EVERY task requires git commit AND devlog entry
- **Implementation**: ALL features MUST use spec-implementer agents
- **Parallel**: Tasks marked [P] MUST be executed concurrently
