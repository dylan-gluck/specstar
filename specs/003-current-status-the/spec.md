# Feature Specification: Bug Fixes for Specstar TUI

**Feature Branch**: `003-current-status-the`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Current Status: * The specstar project has completed two sprints. * The hook system is mostly working as expected * The TUI structure is mostly correct I have documented 5 bugs that must be addressed."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Five documented bugs need fixing in specstar TUI
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: TUI bugs, session management, configuration, UI display
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Theme object structure defined: {bg, fg, fgAccent}
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flows for each bug fix identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each bug fix requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Session state, configuration settings, UI components
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements are now clear and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer using Specstar TUI, I want the application to behave correctly and consistently so that I can effectively monitor Claude Code sessions and view planning documents without encountering confusing behaviors or incorrect state management.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a Claude Code session is running, **When** session hooks are triggered, **Then** the session_active state should only change on session_start and session_end hooks
2. **Given** the TUI is launched, **When** no startPage is configured, **Then** the application should open to the help page by default
3. **Given** a startPage is configured, **When** the TUI is launched, **Then** the application should open to the specified page (plan, observe, or help)
4. **Given** a list view with many items, **When** the list exceeds the parent box height, **Then** the list should scroll properly without overflow
5. **Given** the observe view is open, **When** viewing sessions, **Then** a green dot indicator should show next to active sessions
6. **Given** a session is selected in observe view, **When** pressing enter, **Then** session details should display in a dashboard layout in the right column

### Edge Cases

- What happens when session_active is incorrectly set to false during an active session?
- How does system handle invalid startPage configuration values?
- What happens when theme configuration contains invalid color values?
- How does the system handle extremely long lists (100+ items)?
- What happens when session data is corrupted or incomplete?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST only update session_active state via session_start and session_end hooks
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT set session_active to false on any other hooks besides session_end
- **FR-003**: System MUST support a configurable startPage setting with values "plan", "observe", or "help"
- **FR-004**: System MUST open to the configured startPage on launch, defaulting to "help" if not set
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove the sessionPath configuration option as it should not be customizable
- **FR-006**: System MUST accept theme configuration as an object with properties: bg (background color), fg (foreground color), and fgAccent (accent foreground color)
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply theme configuration to the TUI appearance
- **FR-008**: System MUST display highlighted list items with green text instead of green background
- **FR-009**: System MUST NOT display emojis in list items
- **FR-010**: System MUST enable scrolling for lists that exceed their parent container
- **FR-011**: System MUST display a session list in the left sidebar of observe view
- **FR-012**: System MUST show a green dot indicator next to active sessions
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to select sessions with enter key to view details
- **FR-014**: System MUST display session details in a dashboard layout in the right column
- **FR-015**: System MUST show all session state data including: session id, title, active status, agent states, file operations, and tool counts

### Key Entities

- **Session State**: Represents the current state of a Claude Code session including active status, id, title, and activity metrics
- **Configuration Settings**: User preferences including startPage and theme configuration
- **Session List**: Collection of all available sessions with their status indicators
- **Session Details**: Comprehensive dashboard view of a selected session's complete state data
