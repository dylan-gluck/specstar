# Feature Specification: Specstar - Multi-Session Observability TUI

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-specstar-plan`
**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "docs/specstar-plan.md"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer using Claude Code, I want to monitor and orchestrate multiple AI agent sessions through a terminal interface, so that I can effectively manage spec-driven development workflows and observe agent activities in real-time.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer has multiple projects, **When** they run specstar in a project directory, **Then** they see a TUI with planning documents and session observability views
2. **Given** specstar is not initialized in a project, **When** a developer runs `specstar --init`, **Then** the system creates necessary directories, configuration files, and integrates with Claude Code hooks
3. **Given** a developer is viewing the Plan view, **When** they press a document folder number key, **Then** that folder is focused and they can navigate its contents with arrow keys
4. **Given** a developer selects a markdown document in Plan view, **When** they press enter, **Then** the document content is rendered in the right column viewer
5. **Given** Claude Code is running with hooks configured, **When** session events occur, **Then** the session state is automatically logged to the specstar sessions folder
6. **Given** a developer is in Observe view, **When** they select a session, **Then** they see a real-time dashboard showing teams, agents, tasks, and activity
7. **Given** session data is being updated by hooks, **When** the JSON changes, **Then** the dashboard updates automatically without manual refresh

### Edge Cases

- What happens when specstar is run in a non-project directory?
- How does system handle corrupted session state files?
- What happens when Claude Code hooks fail to execute?
- How does the TUI handle terminal resize events?
- What happens when a markdown document is too large to render?
- How does the system handle concurrent Claude Code sessions?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a terminal user interface accessible via `specstar` command
- **FR-002**: System MUST support initialization via `specstar --init` to set up project integration
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically capture Claude Code session data through configured hooks
- **FR-004**: System MUST display planning documents from configured folders in an expandable tree view
- **FR-005**: System MUST render markdown documents when selected in the Plan view
- **FR-006**: System MUST list all sessions (active and completed) in the Observe view
- **FR-007**: System MUST display real-time session metrics in a dashboard format
- **FR-008**: System MUST support keyboard navigation with documented key bindings
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow switching between Plan and Observe views via keystrokes
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist session state data in JSON format
- **FR-011**: System MUST support global installation for use across multiple projects
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate with Claude Code lifecycle events through hooks
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically update dashboard when session JSON changes
- **FR-014**: System MUST support configurable document folder paths via settings
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle as many sessions as the user is running on the machine
- **FR-016**: Dashboard MUST show data captured in session state object (active/complete subagents, tool count, tasks, etc)
- **FR-017**: System MUST handle errors when an error is returned from a hook (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc)

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Session**: Represents a Claude Code work session, contains ID, title, status (active/suspended), timestamps, and activity log
- **Team**: Logical grouping of agents (Engineering, Product, QA, DevOps), contains member count and status
- **Agent**: Individual AI agent instance, has name, status, and current task assignment
- **Task**: Work item with status (todo/in-progress/done), belongs to epic/story context
- **Document**: Markdown file in configured folders, has path, title, and content
- **Settings**: Configuration for document folders, hook scripts, and display preferences
- **Hook Event**: Claude Code lifecycle event that triggers state updates
