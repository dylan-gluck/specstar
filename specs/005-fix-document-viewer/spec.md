# Feature Specification: Fix Document Viewer Layout and Rendering

**Feature Branch**: `005-fix-document-viewer`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix document viewer layout and rendering in plan view"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üìù Note: Test infrastructure and language-specific debugger will be set up with project initialization per constitution
- üîç Note: Debugger (pyright/gopls/rust-analyzer etc.) ensures type checking and code intelligence during development
- ü§ñ Note: ALL feature implementation will be completed using spec-implementer agents

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the specstar TUI application, I want to view planning documents in the plan view with proper layout and error handling, so that I can read full document content clearly and navigate documents effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is in the plan view with documents available, **When** they select a document to view, **Then** the document viewer should expand to fill the available parent column space
2. **Given** a user is viewing a markdown document, **When** the document contains standard markdown formatting, **Then** the content should display without parsing errors
3. **Given** a user is viewing a long document, **When** the content exceeds the visible area, **Then** they should be able to scroll vertically through the content
4. **Given** a user is viewing a document with long lines, **When** text exceeds the column width, **Then** text should wrap horizontally within the viewer

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a document fails to load due to parsing errors? System should display a user-friendly error message with the document filename
- How does system handle documents with special markdown syntax or complex formatting? System should gracefully fallback to plain text display if markdown parsing fails
- What happens when window is resized? Document viewer should responsively adjust to fill available space

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Document viewer MUST expand to fill the entire available parent column space when displaying content
- **FR-002**: System MUST successfully parse and display standard markdown documents without errors
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to scroll vertically through document content when it exceeds the visible area
- **FR-004**: System MUST wrap text horizontally when content exceeds the column width
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear, user-friendly error messages when document loading fails
- **FR-006**: Document viewer MUST maintain consistent layout similar to the observe view's session dashboard
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle various markdown document formats including those with complex syntax
- **FR-008**: Navigation controls MUST remain visible and functional while viewing documents

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document**: Represents a markdown or text file displayed in the viewer, contains title and content
- **Document Viewer**: Visual component that renders document content with proper layout and scrolling capabilities
- **Error State**: Represents document loading failures with filename and error description
