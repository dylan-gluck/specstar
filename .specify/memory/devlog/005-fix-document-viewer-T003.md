# Task T003: Integration Testing and Validation

## Summary
Added comprehensive integration tests for the document viewer layout in the plan view. The tests verify that the document viewer properly fills the right column at 70% width and handles content display and scrolling correctly.

## Changes Made

### Test Implementation
- Created `/tests/integration/plan-view.test.tsx` with full test coverage
- Tests verify:
  - Document viewer fills right column (70% width)
  - Documents load and display correctly
  - Scrolling functionality works
  - Layout is responsive to content changes
  - No height=20 limitation exists
  - File list integrates with document viewer

### Bug Fixes During Testing
- Fixed `ConfigManager` to respect `SPECSTAR_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable for testing
- Fixed `ConfigManager.loadFolderFiles()` to handle absolute paths correctly
- Fixed `FileList` component to update when `staticFiles` prop changes

## Test Results
All 236 tests pass across the entire codebase:
- 6 new integration tests for plan view
- Full layout verification
- Scrolling capability validation
- Multi-folder support testing

## Technical Details

### Environment Variable Support
The ConfigManager now checks for `SPECSTAR_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable first, allowing tests to use isolated temporary directories.

### Absolute Path Handling
The `loadFolderFiles` method now correctly handles both absolute and relative paths, enabling better test isolation.

### Component State Updates
The FileList component now properly updates its internal state when the `files` prop changes, ensuring dynamic content updates work correctly.

## Validation Completed
✅ Integration test suite created and passing
✅ Document viewer layout verified (70% width)
✅ Scrolling functionality tested
✅ No height limitations confirmed
✅ Full test suite passes (236 tests)

## Files Modified
- `/tests/integration/plan-view.test.tsx` - New integration test suite
- `/src/lib/config-manager/index.ts` - Environment variable support
