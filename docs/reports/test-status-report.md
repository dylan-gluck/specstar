# Test Status Report

## Date: 2025-09-09

## Summary

This report documents the current test suite status for the Specstar project, specifically highlighting tests that have been skipped due to unimplemented features. These skipped tests serve as a roadmap for future development work.

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 40+
- **Categories**: Contract Tests, Integration Tests, Unit Tests, E2E Tests
- **Status**: Mixed (Passing, Failing, Skipped)

## Skipped Tests by Category

### 1. CLI Tool Contract Tests (Not Implemented)

The following CLI tools are referenced in tests but do not exist as standalone executables:

#### **Note**: Some CLI tools referenced in original design have been removed during cleanup

#### **specstar-hook-integrator**
- **Location**: `tests/contract/cli-hook-integrator.test.ts`
- **Status**: Entire test suite skipped
- **Purpose**: Would manage Claude Code lifecycle hooks
- **Features Expected**:
  - Install hooks in project
  - Uninstall hooks
  - List available hooks
  - Validate hook files
  - Run specific hooks with arguments


### 2. TUI Launch Tests (Partially Implemented)

**Location**: `tests/contract/cli-main-tui.test.ts`

#### Skipped Tests:
- `should launch TUI when run without arguments` - TUI launches but test environment issues
- `should check for .specstar directory before launching` - Directory check not implemented

### 3. Session Monitoring Integration Tests

**Location**: `tests/integration/session-monitor.test.ts`

#### Skipped Tests:
- `should detect new Claude Code session` - Watcher not detecting new sessions
- `should monitor file changes in active session` - File change detection not working
- `should track command execution in session` - Command tracking not implemented
- `should detect session end` - Session end detection not working
- `should save session history` - History persistence not implemented
- `should integrate with lifecycle hooks` - Hook integration incomplete

### 4. Plan View Navigation Tests

**Location**: `tests/integration/plan-navigation.test.tsx`

#### Skipped Tests:
- `should navigate between documents with arrow keys` - Navigation not fully implemented
- `should wrap navigation at boundaries` - Boundary wrapping not implemented
- `should load document content on Enter key` - Document loading not working
- `should support vim-style navigation (j/k)` - Vim bindings not implemented
- `should scroll document content with Page Up/Down` - Scrolling not implemented
- `should search within documents with /` - Search functionality not implemented
- `should switch focus between panes with Tab` - Focus management incomplete
- `should handle keyboard shortcuts for common actions` - Shortcuts not implemented
- `should maintain scroll position when switching documents` - Scroll position not tracked
- `should handle rapid navigation without errors` - Rapid navigation handling needed

### 5. Error Recovery Tests

**Location**: `tests/integration/error-recovery.test.tsx`

#### Skipped Tests:
- `should display error boundary for component crashes` - Error boundary needs fixing
- `should handle terminal resize gracefully` - Terminal resize handling incomplete

### 6. Hook Contract Tests

**Location**: `tests/contract/hooks/stop.test.ts`

#### Skipped Tests:
- `should execute the actual stop hook implementation` - Actual hook implementation pending

## Implementation Priority

Based on the skipped tests, the following features should be prioritized:

### High Priority
1. **Session Monitoring**: Core functionality for tracking Claude Code sessions
2. **Plan View Navigation**: Essential for user interaction with documents
3. **Error Boundaries**: Critical for application stability

### Medium Priority
1. **Configuration Management**: Important for customization
2. **Document Viewing**: Enhances document interaction
3. **Hook Integration**: Enables Claude Code integration

### Low Priority
1. **Standalone CLI Tools**: Can be accessed through main CLI
2. **Advanced Navigation**: Vim bindings, rapid navigation
3. **Export Features**: Session export formats

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Core Features**: Prioritize session monitoring and basic navigation
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Build features incrementally, enabling tests as they're completed
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Use skipped tests as specifications for implementation
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation as features are implemented
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Keep skipped tests in CI to track progress

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize skipped test implementations
2. Create implementation tasks for high-priority features
3. Update test expectations to match design decisions
4. Consider removing tests for features that won't be implemented
5. Add new tests for features not currently covered

## Conclusion

The test suite provides a comprehensive specification for the Specstar project. While many features are not yet implemented, the skipped tests serve as valuable documentation of intended functionality. By systematically implementing these features and enabling their tests, the project can achieve its full potential as a Claude Code session monitoring and planning tool.
