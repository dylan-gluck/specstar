# Specstar

Platform + CLI tool for collaborative spec-driven development.

Main Features:
* Project specs and documentation maintained independently from codebase
* Integrated knowledge graph for large codebase understanding and dependency mapping
* Agentic tasks and workflows for planning features, epics, sprints and whole projects
* Web-ui for managing projects, tasks and requirements
* CLI tool that connects coding agents to the platform within project repo

## Components

### Platform

* Platform as a service, open-source community edition run locally
* User authentication, user can belong to an organization
* Projects belong to user or organization
* Each project has a Knowledge-graph and markdown documents

### CLI Tool

* CLI tool `specstar` connects to platform instance (API key)
* Commands to fetch project context, specs, requirements
* Observibility hooks to monitor sessions

- updatedAt (datetime)
- name (string)
- description (string)
- status ("pending", "in-progress", "completed")
- project_id (string) [Project.id]


### Project Docs

Every project has a standard set of documents that are maintained in combination with the knowledge graph for codebase understanding and dependency mapping over time.

*Documentation pattern influenced by spec-kit and bmad-method*
*TODO: Where do we store the templates?*

Constitution
* Core principals and conventions
* Organized by `articles` - each article has a title and declarations
* Referenced during all phases of planning

Specs
* Technical specification documents
* Tech Stack (Languages, DB)
* Data Model (Types, Schema)
* Tools (Libraries, Frameworks, Testing)
* Front-end Spec (Components, Views, Contracts)
* Back-end Spec (APIs, Routes, Contracts)
* Deployment (Hosting, CI/CD)

PRDs
* Product Requirement Documents
* User Stories
* Functional Requirements
* Non-functional Requirements
* Acceptance Criteria

### Document Editing

Project documents should be editable by organization members with permission.

Ideas:
* Markdown editor with preview
* Action to trigger agent tasks or workflows
* Multi-user editing (real-time collaboration ?)
